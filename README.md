# üöó Vehicle Classification using Deep Learning (I2V Assessment)

This project is an **AI-based Vehicle Classification System** developed as part of the **I2V Solution Assessment**.  
It classifies vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, vans, autorickshaws) using a fine-tuned **ResNet-50** model implemented in **PyTorch**.

---

## üß† Overview

The goal is to accurately classify different types of vehicles from images.  
We trained a deep convolutional neural network and evaluated it on the validation and test sets, producing metrics such as:
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Accuracy Curve
- Loss Curve

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

- **Base Model:** ResNet-50 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Framework:** PyTorch
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** CrossEntropyLoss
- **Epochs:** 20 (fine-tuned)
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Learning Rate:** 1e-4

## üìä Results Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | 93.6% |
| **Precision** | 92.8% |
| **Recall** | 93.1% |
| **F1-score** | 93.0% |

> Example predictions:
> - `autorickshaw.png ‚Üí truck (0.760)`
> - `car.png ‚Üí car (0.995)`
> - `van.png ‚Üí car (0.876)`
